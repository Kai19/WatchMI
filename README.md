WatchMI: Pressure Touch, Twist and Pan Gesture Input on Unmodified Smartwatches

Watch the demo video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74roE_cyafk

We present WatchMI: Watch Movement Input that enhances touch interaction on a smartwatch to support continuous pressure touch, twist, pan gestures and their combinations. Our novel approach relies on software that analyzes, in real-time, the data from a built-in Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) in order to determine with great accuracy and different levels of granularity the actions performed by the user, without requiring additional hardware or modification of the watch.

This is a simplified version from the paper, the algorithm is simpler but should work equally well.
Not all sample apps are included in this version.

Get it from playstore here: 
Install to your phone and wait for it to sync with your smartwatch.
(In some rare occasion it didn't sync then get the wear APK from here and sideload it to your watch.)

Doesn't work well on watch without magnetometer such as Huawei watch v1.

To do...
